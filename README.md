Known Problems
--------------

- Gear VR Controllers doesn't allow the player to play the contest duo to it's movement range
(Controllers Source Code and hardware need a lot of modifactions to fix the problem)

- Slow Movement 
(Because ARCore plane detection is so slow - preformance can be increased by walking in a colorful open area with a good lighting)

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Samsung Gear VR
